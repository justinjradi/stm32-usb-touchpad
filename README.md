STM32 firmware emulating a USB Precision Touchpad.

Implemented on a F446ZE development board as a FS device using ST's USB Device Library and tested with Windows hosts.

I'm not aware of any other open-source implementations of multi-touch touchpad device firmware at the moment. I plan to make a more reusable version or post my TinyUSB implementation in the future, but if you'd like clarification on this repo or advice about implementing this type of device in the meantime, feel free to connect with me in the discussions tab.
